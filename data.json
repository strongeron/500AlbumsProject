[{"id":"1","artist":"The Beatles","album":"\u2018Sgt. Pepper\u2019s Lonely Hearts Club Band\u2019","label_year":"Capitol, 1967","description":"Sgt. Pepper\u2019s Lonely Hearts Club Band is the most important rock & roll album ever made, an unsurpassed adventure in concept, sound, songwriting, cover art and studio technology by the greatest rock & roll group of all time. From the title song\u2019s regal blasts of brass and fuzz guitar to the orchestral seizure and long, dying piano chord at the end of \u201cA Day in the Life,\u201d the 13 tracks on Sgt. Pepper\u2019s Lonely Hearts Club Band are the pinnacle of the Beatles\u2019 eight years as recording artists. John Lennon, Paul McCartney, George Harrison and Ringo Starr were never more fearless and unified in their pursuit of magic and transcendence.\n\nIssued in Britain on June 1st, 1967, and a day later in America, Sgt. Pepper is also rock\u2019s ultimate declaration of change. For the Beatles, it was a decisive goodbye to matching suits, world tours and assembly-line record-making. \u201cWe were fed up with being Beatles,\u201d McCartney said decades later, in Many Years From Now, Barry Miles\u2019 McCartney biography. \u201cWe were not boys, we were men\u2026 artists rather than performers.\n\nAt the same time, Sgt. Pepper formally ushered in an unforgettable season of hope, upheaval and achievement: the late 1960s and, in particular, 1967\u2019s Summer of Love. In its iridescent instrumentation, lyric fantasias and eye-popping packaging, Sgt. Pepper defined the opulent revolutionary optimism of psychedelia and instantly spread the gospel of love, acid, Eastern spirituality and electric guitars around the globe. No other pop record of that era, or since, has had such an immediate, titanic impact. This music documents the world\u2019s biggest rock band at the very height of its influence and ambition.\n\n\u201cIt was a peak,\u201d Lennon told Rolling Stone in 1970, describing both the album and his collaborative relationship with McCartney. \u201cPaul and I were definitely working together,\u201d Lennon said, and Sgt. Pepper is rich with proof: McCartney\u2019s burst of hot piano and school-days memoir (\u201cWoke up, fell out of bed\u2026\u201d) in Lennon\u2019s \u201cA Day in the Life,\u201d a reverie on mortality and infinity; Lennon\u2019s impish rejoinder to McCartney\u2019s chorus in \u201cGetting Better\u201d (\u201cIt can\u2019t get no worse\u201d).\n\n\u201cSgt. Pepper was our grandest endeavor,\u201d Starr said, looking back, in the band\u2019s 2000 autobiography, The Beatles Anthology. \u201cThe greatest thing about the band was that whoever had the best idea \u2013 it didn\u2019t matter who \u2013 that was the one we\u2019d use.\u201d It was Neil Aspinall, the Beatles\u2019 longtime assistant, who suggested they reprise the title track, just before the finale of \u201cA Day in the Life,\u201d to complete Sgt. Pepper\u2018s theatrical conceit: an imaginary concert by a fictional band, played by the Beatles.\n\nThe first notes went to tape on December 6th, 1966: two takes of McCartney\u2019s music-hall confection \u201cWhen I\u2019m Sixty-Four.\u201d (Lennon\u2019s lysergic reflection on his Liverpool childhood, \u201cStrawberry Fields Forever,\u201d was started two weeks earlier but issued in February 1967 as a stand-alone single.) But Sgt. Pepper\u2018s real birthday is August 29th, 1966, when the Beatles played their last live concert, in San Francisco. Until then, they had made history in the studio between punishing tours. Off the road for good, the Beatles were free to be a band away from the hysteria of Beatlemania.\n\nMcCartney went a step further. On a plane to London in November \u201966, as he returned from a vacation in Kenya, he came up with the idea of an album by the Beatles in disguise, an alter-ego group that he subsequently dubbed Sgt. Pepper\u2019s Lonely Hearts Club Band. \u201cWe\u2019d pretend to be someone else,\u201d McCartney explained in Anthology. \u201cIt liberated you \u2013 you could do anything when you got to the mic or on your guitar, because it wasn\u2019t you.\u201d\n\nOnly two songs on the final LP, both McCartney\u2019s, had anything to do with the Pepper characters: the title track and Starr\u2019s jaunty vocal showcase, \u201cWith a Little Help From My Friends,\u201d introduced as a number by Sgt. Pepper\u2018s star crooner, Billy Shears. \u201cEvery other song could have been on any other album,\u201d Lennon insisted later. Yet it is hard to imagine a more perfect setting for the Victorian jollity of Lennon\u2019s \u201cBeing for the Benefit of Mr. Kite!\u201d (inspired by an 1843 circus poster) or the sumptuous melancholy of McCartney\u2019s \u201cFixing a Hole,\u201d with its blend of antique shadows (a harpsichord played by the Beatles\u2019 producer, George Martin) and modern sunshine (double-tracked lead guitar executed with ringing precision by Harrison). The Pepper premise was a license to thrill.\n\nIt also underscored the real-life cohesion of the music and the group that made it. Of the 700 hours the Beatles spent making Sgt. Pepper from the end of 1966 until April 1967, the group needed only three days\u2019 worth to complete Lennon\u2019s lavish daydream \u201cLucy in the Sky With Diamonds.\u201d \u201cA Day in the Life,\u201d the most complex song on the album, was done in just five days. (The oceanic piano chord was three pianos hit simultaneously by 10 hands belonging to Lennon, McCartney, Starr, Martin and Beatles roadie Mal Evans.) No other Beatles appear with Harrison on his sitar-perfumed sermon on materialism and fidelity, \u201cWithin You Without You,\u201d but the band wisely placed the track at the halfway point of the original vinyl LP, at the beginning of Side Two: a vital meditation break in the middle of the jubilant indulgence.\n\nThe Beatles\u2019 exploitation of multitracking transformed the very act of studio recording (the orchestral overdubs on \u201cA Day in the Life\u201d marked the debut of eight-track recording in Britain: two four-track machines used in sync). And Sgt. Pepper\u2018s visual extravagance officially elevated the album cover to a work of art. Michael Cooper\u2019s photo of the Beat\u00adles in satin marching-band outfits, in front of a cardboard-cutout audience of historical figures, created by artist Peter Blake, is the most enduring image of the psychedelic era. Sgt. Pepper was also the first rock album to incorporate complete lyrics to the songs in its design.\n\nYet Sgt. Pepper is the Number One album of the RS 500 not just because of its firsts \u2013 it is simply the best of everything the Beatles ever did as musicians, pioneers and pop stars, all in one place. A 1967 British print ad for the album declared, \u201cRemember, Sgt. Pepper\u2019s Lonely Hearts Club Band Is the Beatles.\u201d As McCartney put it, the album was \u201cjust us doing a good show.\u201d\n\nThe show goes on forever.","cover":"https:\/\/www.rollingstone.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/06\/sgt-peppers-e4860c12-4da1-4e6d-bb86-81698a88dbde.jpg?resize=1240,1240&w=385","playlist":"https:\/\/music.yandex.ru\/iframe\/#album\/5788435","Collection":"","\u0424\u043e\u043d\u043e\u0442\u0435\u043a\u0430":"\u0440.2\u00a0790,00","":"","Vinylbox.ru":"\u0440.2\u00a0650,00","\u0414\u0438\u0435\u0437":"\u0440.3\u00a0300,00","Audiomania.ru":"\u0440.3\u00a0300,00"},{"id":"2","artist":"The Beach Boys","album":"\u2018Pet Sounds\u2019","label_year":"Capitol, 1966","description":"\"Who's gonna hear this shit?\" Beach Boys singer Mike Love asked the band's resident genius, Brian Wilson, in 1966, as Wilson played him the new songs he was working on. \"The ears of a dog?\" But Love's contempt proved oddly useful: \"Ironically,\" Wilson observed, \"Mike's barb inspired the album's title.\" Barking dogs \u2013 Wilson's dog Banana among them, in fact \u2013 are prominent among the found sounds on the album. The Beatles made a point of echoing them on Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band \u2013 an acknowledgment that Pet Sounds was the inspiration for the Beatles' masterpiece. That gesture actually completed a circle of influence: Wilson initially conceived of Pet Sounds as an effort to top the Beatles' Rubber Soul.\n\nWith its vivid orchestration, lyrical ambition, elegant pacing and thematic coherence, Pet Sounds invented \u2013 and in some sense perfected \u2013 the idea that an album could be more than the sum of its parts. When Wilson sang, \"Wouldn't it be nice if we were older?\" on the magnificent opener, he wasn't just imagining a love that could evolve past high school; he was suggesting a new grown-up identity for rock & roll music itself.\n\nWilson essentially made Pet Sounds without the rest of the band, using them only to flesh out the vocal arrangements. (He even considered putting the album out as a solo project, and the first single, \"Caroline, No,\" was released under his own name.) Its luxurious sound conveys a heartbreaking wistfulness, and the deeply personal songs, which Wilson co-wrote primarily with lyricist Tony Asher, bid farewell to the innocent world of the Beach Boys' fun-in-the-sun hits. Unfortunately, Capitol Records proved no more enamored of Pet Sounds than had Love; the label considered not releasing it at all. Not yet vindicated by history, Wilson withdrew further into his inner world. \"At the last meeting I attended concerning Pet Sounds,\" Wilson wrote about his dealings with the label, \"I showed up holding a tape player and eight prerecorded, looped responses, including 'No comment,' 'Can you repeat that?' 'No' and 'Yes.' Refusing to utter a word, I played the various tapes when appropriate.\"","cover":"https:\/\/www.rollingstone.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/06\/rs-136791-eafbc592120358b4d3d14cda5acebf62ae50a522.jpg?resize=1240,1240&w=385","playlist":"https:\/\/music.yandex.ru\/iframe\/#album\/7551970","Collection":"","\u0424\u043e\u043d\u043e\u0442\u0435\u043a\u0430":"\u0440.1\u00a0990,00","":"","Vinylbox.ru":"","\u0414\u0438\u0435\u0437":"","Audiomania.ru":""},{"id":"3","artist":"The Beatles","album":"\u2018Revolver\u2019","label_year":"Capitol, 1966","description":"\"I don't see too much difference between Revolver and Rubber Soul,\" George Harrison once said. \"To me, they could be Volume One and Volume Two.\" Revolver extends the more adventurous aspects of its predecessor \u2013 its introspection, its nascent psychedelia, its fascination with studio artistry \u2013 into a dramatic statement of generational possibility.\n\nThe album, which was released in August 1966, made it thrillingly clear that what we now think of as \"the Sixties\" was fully \u2013 and irreversibly \u2013 under way.\n\nThe most innovative track on the album is John Lennon's \"Tomorrow Never Knows.\" Attempting to distill an LSD trip into a three-minute song, Lennon borrowed lyrics from Timothy Leary's version of The Tibetan Book of the Dead, and recorded his vocal to sound like \"the Dalai Lama singing from the highest mountaintop.\" Tape loops, a backward guitar part (Paul McCartney's blistering solo on \"Taxman,\" in fact) and a droning tamboura completed the experimental effect, and the song proved hugely influential. For his part, on \"Eleanor Rigby\" and \"For No One,\" McCartney mastered a strikingly mature form of art song, and Harrison, with \"Taxman,\" \"I Want to Tell You\" and \"Love You To,\" challenged Lennon-McCartney's songwriting dominance.\n\nPart of the album's revolutionary impulse was visual. Klaus Voormann, one of the Beatles' artist buddies from their days in Hamburg, Germany, designed a striking photo-collage cover for Revolver; it was a crucial step on the road to the even trippier, more colorful imagery of Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band, which would come less than a year later.\n\nRevolver signaled that in popular music, anything \u2013 any theme, any musical idea \u2013 could now be realized.

In and of itself, \"Like a Rolling Stone,\" rumored to be about Andy Warhol acolyte Edie Sedgwick, forever altered the landscape of popular music \u2013 its \"vomiti\ufb01c\" flow (Dylan's term), literary ambition and sheer length (6:13) shattered limitations of every kind. \"Ballad of a Thin Man\" delivered the definitive Sixties comment on the splintering hip-straight fault line: \"Something is happening here, but you don't know what it is\/Do you, Mister Jones?\" If anyone questioned whether or not Dylan had truly \u2009\"gone electric,\" the roaring rock & roll of \u2006\"From a Buick 6\" and \"Tombstone Blues\" \u2013 powered by guitarist Mike Bloom\ufb01eld \u2013 left no doubt.\n\nThe album ends with \"Desolation Row,\" a surrealist night journey that runs 11 minutes.

Producer George Martin described Rubber Soul as \"the first album to present a new, growing Beatles to the world,\" and so it was.\n\nThe moptops were evolving in remarkable ways. \"Drive My Car\" is a comic character study of a sort not previously in the Beatles' repertoire. More profoundly, however, Bob Dylan's influence suffuses the album, accounting for the tart emotional tone of \"Norwegian Wood,\" \"I'm Looking Through You,\" \"You Won't See Me\" and \"If I Needed Someone.\" (Dylan would return the compliment the following year, when he offered his own version of \"Norwegian Wood\" \u2013 titled \"4th Time Around\" \u2013 on Blonde on Blonde, and reportedly made John Lennon paranoid.) Lennon's \"Nowhere Man,\" which he later acknowledged as a depressed self-portrait, and the beautifully reminiscent \"In My Life\" both reflect the more serious and personal style of songwriting that Dylan had suddenly made possible.\n\nGeorge Harrison's sitar on \"Norwegian Wood\" \u2013 the first time the instrument was used in a pop song \u2013 and Paul McCartney's fuzz bass on \"Think for Yourself\" document the band's increasing awareness that the studio could be more than a pit stop between tours. Harrison called Rubber Soul \"the best one we made,\" because \"we were suddenly hearing sounds that we weren't able to hear before.\" And as for why the band's hearing had grown so acute, well, that was another aspect of the times. \"There was a lot of experimentation on Rubber Soul,\" said Ringo Starr, \"influenced, I think, by the substances.\"","cover":"https:\/\/www.rollingstone.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/06\/rs-136794-6a2b508760f8dfca2260822c63640baa769795b4.jpg?resize=1240,1240&w=385","playlist":"https:\/\/music.yandex.ru\/iframe\/#album\/3277323","Collection":"","\u0424\u043e\u043d\u043e\u0442\u0435\u043a\u0430":"\u0440.1\u00a0990,00","":"","Vinylbox.ru":"","\u0414\u0438\u0435\u0437":"","Audiomania.ru":""},{"id":"6","artist":"Marvin Gaye","album":"\u2018What\u2019s Going On\u2019","label_year":"Motown, 1971","description":"\"In 1969 or 1970, I began to re-evaluate my whole concept of what I wanted my music to say,\" Marvin Gaye said. \"I was very much affected by letters my brother was sending me from Vietnam, as well as the social situation here at home. I realized that I had to put my own fantasies behind me if I wanted to write songs that would reach the souls of people. I wanted them to take a look at what was happening in the world.\" The masterpiece that followed Gaye's awakening revolutionized black music. From its rich, string-suffused grooves to its boundless sense of possibility, What's Going On is the Sgt. Pepper of soul.\n\nGaye was determined to shatter Motown's pop formula and address pressing social issues. Motown founder Berry Gordy was not pleased. He claimed that \"What's Going On\" was the worst song he had ever heard. As for \"Mercy Mercy Me (The Ecology),\" Gordy asserted that he didn't even know what the word \"ecology\" meant. Gaye responded that he would never record for Motown again unless \"What's Going On\" was released as a single. After initially being rejected by Motown's quality-control committee, it was; when the song became a Top Five hit, the album \u2013 and a burst of socially conscious music from Motown \u2013 followed soon after. Working amid a haze of marijuana smoke, Gaye made one intuitively brilliant decision after another \u2013 from letting the tapes roll as his friends mingled to recording the rehearsal exercises of saxophonist Eli Fontaine. When Fontaine told Gaye that he had just been goofing around, Gaye replied, \"Well, you goof exquisitely. Thank you.\" And that's how the plaintive saxophone line that announces What's Going On came to be.","cover":"https:\/\/www.rollingstone.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/06\/rs-136795-89f4e4079e43af44a80043f496eebfc562e3c9ec.jpg?resize=1240,1240&w=385","playlist":"https:\/\/music.yandex.ru\/iframe\/#album\/87116","Collection":"","\u0424\u043e\u043d\u043e\u0442\u0435\u043a\u0430":"","":"","Vinylbox.ru":"","\u0414\u0438\u0435\u0437":"","Audiomania.ru":""},{"id":"7","artist":"The Rolling Stones","album":"\u2018Exile on Main Street\u2019","label_year":"Rolling Stones Records, 1972","description":"A dirty whirl of blues and boogie, the Rolling Stones' 1972 double LP \"was the first grunge record,\" guitarist Keith Richards crowed proudly in a 2002 interview.

In the existential shuffle \"Tumbling Dice,\" the exhausted country beauty \"Torn and Frayed\" and the whiskey-soaked uplift of \"Shine a Light,\" you literally hear the Stones in exile: working at Richards' villa in the South of France, and on the run from media censure, British drug police (Jagger and Richards already knew the view from behind bars) and the country's onerous tax code. Exile is rife with allusions to their outsider status: The album's cover is a collage of freakish American characters, and on \"Sweet Black Angel\" they toast imprisoned activist Angela Davis \u2013 one set of renegades to another. The music rattles like battle but also swings with clear purpose on songs like \"Rocks Off\" and \"All Down the Line.\" As Richards explained, \"The Stones don't have a home anymore \u2013 hence the Exile \u2013 but they can still keep it together. Whatever people throw at us, we can still duck, improvise, overcome.\" Great example: Richards recorded his jubilant romp \"Happy\" with just producer Jimmy Miller on drums and saxman Bobby Keys \u2013 while waiting for the other Stones to turn up for work.

Yet the creative tension resulted in one of the most intense and adventurous rock albums ever made. Lennon pursued his hard-edged vision into the cynical wit of \"Sexy Sadie\" and \"Happiness Is a Warm Gun,\" but also infused \"Julia\" and \"Dear Prudence\" with childlike yearning. Paul McCartney's playful pop energy came through on his inversion of Chuck Berry's American values, \"Back in the U.S.S.R.,\" and he showed off his raucous side in \"Helter Skelter.\" Harrison's spiritual yearning led him to \"Long, Long, Long\" and \"While My Guitar Gently Weeps,\" featuring a guest guitar solo from Eric Clapton. Even Starr contributed his first original, the country-tinged \"Don't Pass Me By.\" \"I think it was a very good album,\" said McCartney. \"It stood up, but it wasn't a pleasant one to make.\"","cover":"https:\/\/www.rollingstone.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/06\/rs-136799-c851b340c6dccdeafaeb8d147ea084cba2e06236.jpg?resize=1240,1240&w=385","playlist":"https:\/\/music.yandex.ru\/iframe\/#album\/3277242","Collection":"","\u0424\u043e\u043d\u043e\u0442\u0435\u043a\u0430":"\u0440.2\u00a0990,00","":"","Vinylbox.ru":"","\u0414\u0438\u0435\u0437":"","Audiomania.ru":""},{"id":"11","artist":"Elvis Presley","album":"\u2018The Sun Sessions\u2019","label_year":"RCA, 1999","description":"Many believe rock & roll was born on July 5th, 1954, at Sun Studio in Memphis. Elvis Presley, guitarist Scotty Moore and bassist Bill Black were horsing around with \"That's All Right, Mama,\" a tune by bluesman Arthur \"Big Boy\" Crudup, when producer Sam Phillips stopped them and asked, \"What are you doing?\" \"We don't know,\" they said. Phillips told them to \"back up and do it again.\" The A side of Presley's first single (backed with a version of Bill Monroe's \"Blue Moon of Kentucky\"), \"That's All Right\" was issued by Sun on July 19th. It may or may not be the first rock & roll record. But the man who would be King was officially on wax. Bridging black and white, country and blues, his sound was playful and revolutionary, charged by a spontaneity and freedom that changed the world. \"It's the blues,\" critic Greil Marcus wrote in his classic book Mystery Train. \"But free of all worry, all sin; a simple joy with no price to pay.\" Presley released four more singles on Sun \u2013 including definitive reinventions of Wynonie Harris' \"Good Rockin' Tonight\" and Junior Parker's \"Mystery Train\" \u2013 before moving on to immortality when Phillips sold his contract to RCA for $35,000. Incredibly, it took more than 20 years for Presley's Sun output to be properly collected on a 1976 LP \u2013 which has since been superseded by this 1999 double-CD chronicle of the King's beginnings at Sun. It collects everything he cut at the studio, including alternate takes and the 1953 acetate he recorded as a gift for his mother as a shy and awkward recent high school graduate.","cover":"https:\/\/www.rollingstone.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/06\/rs-136800-7a33165e92d530dd0f7c190f9dd46f81b95c5913.jpg?resize=1240,1240&w=385","playlist":"","Collection":"","\u0424\u043e\u043d\u043e\u0442\u0435\u043a\u0430":"","":"","Vinylbox.ru":"","\u0414\u0438\u0435\u0437":"","Audiomania.ru":""},{"id":"12","artist":"Miles Davis","album":"\u2018Kind of Blue\u2019","label_year":"Columbia, 1959","description":"This painterly masterpiece would become one of the most important, influential and popular albums in jazz. But at the time it was made, Kind of Blue was a revolution all its own, a radical break from everything going on. Turning his back on standard chord progressions, trumpeter Miles Davis used modal scales as a starting point for composition and improvisation \u2013 breaking new ground with warmth, subtlety and understatement in the thick of hard bop. Davis and his peerless band \u2013 bassist Paul Chambers, drummer Jimmy Cobb, pianist Bill Evans, and the titanic sax team of John Coltrane and Cannonball Adderley \u2013 soloed in uncluttered settings, typified by \"melodic rather than harmonic variation,\" as Davis put it. Two numbers, \"All Blues\" and \"Freddie Freeloader\" (the latter featured Wynton Kelly at the ivories in place of Evans), were in 12-bar form, but Davis' approach allowed his players a cool, new, collected freedom. Evans wrote in his original liner notes, \"Miles conceived these settings only hours before the re\u00adcording dates and arrived with sketches which indicated to the group what was to be played. Therefore, you will hear something close to pure spontaneity in these performances.\" Or as the late critic Robert Palmer wrote, \"Kind of Blue is, in a sense, all melody \u2013 and atmosphere.\" The bass line in \"So What\" is now among the most familiar obbligatos in jazz, and there is no finer evocation of the late-night wonder of jazz than the muted horns in \"All Blues.\"","cover":"https:\/\/images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com\/images\/I\/51Y2V2TT2EL._SX258_BO1,204,203,200_.jpg","playlist":"","Collection":"1","\u0424\u043e\u043d\u043e\u0442\u0435\u043a\u0430":"","":"","Vinylbox.ru":"","\u0414\u0438\u0435\u0437":"","Audiomania.ru":""},{"id":"13","artist":"The Velvet Underground and Nico","album":"\u2018The Velvet Underground\u2019","label_year":"Verve, 1967","description":"","cover":"https:\/\/images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com\/images\/I\/51Y2V2TT2EL._SX258_BO1,204,203,200_.jpg","playlist":"","Collection":"","\u0424\u043e\u043d\u043e\u0442\u0435\u043a\u0430":"\u0440.1\u00a0690,00","":"Mono","Vinylbox.ru":"","\u0414\u0438\u0435\u0437":"","Audiomania.ru":""},{"id":"14","artist":"The Beatles","album":"\u2018Abbey Road\u2019","label_year":"Capitol, 1969","description":"","cover":"https:\/\/images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com\/images\/I\/51Y2V2TT2EL._SX258_BO1,204,203,200_.jpg","playlist":"","Collection":"","\u0424\u043e\u043d\u043e\u0442\u0435\u043a\u0430":"","":"","Vinylbox.ru":"","\u0414\u0438\u0435\u0437":"","Audiomania.ru":""},{"id":"15","artist":"The Jimi Hendrix Experience","album":"\u2018Are You Experienced?\u2019","label_year":"Reprise, 1967","description":"","cover":"https:\/\/images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com\/images\/I\/51Y2V2TT2EL._SX258_BO1,204,203,200_.jpg","playlist":"","Collection":"","\u0424\u043e\u043d\u043e\u0442\u0435\u043a\u0430":"","":"","Vinylbox.ru":"","\u0414\u0438\u0435\u0437":"","Audiomania.ru":""},{"id":"16","artist":"Bob Dylan","album":"\u2018Blood on the Tracks\u2019","label_year":"Columbia, 1975","description":"","cover":"https:\/\/images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com\/images\/I\/51Y2V2TT2EL._SX258_BO1,204,203,200_.jpg","playlist":"","Collection":"","\u0424\u043e\u043d\u043e\u0442\u0435\u043a\u0430":"","":"","Vinylbox.ru":"","\u0414\u0438\u0435\u0437":"","Audiomania.ru":""},{"id":"17","artist":"Nirvana","album":"\u2018Nevermind\u2019","label_year":"Geffen, 1991","description":"The overnight-success story of the 1990s, Nirvana's second album and its totemic first single, \"Smells Like Teen Spirit,\" shot up from the nascent grunge scene in Seattle to kick Michael Jackson off the top of the Billboard album chart and blow hair metal off the map. No album in recent history had such an overpowering impact on a generation \u2013 a nation of teens suddenly turned punk \u2013 and such a catastrophic effect on its main creator. The weight of fame led already troubled singer-guitarist Kurt Cobain to take his own life in 1994. But his slashing riffs, corrosive singing and deviously oblique writing, rammed home by the Pixies-via-Zeppelin might of bassist Krist Novoselic and drummer Dave Grohl, put the warrior purity back in rock & roll. Lyrically, Cobain raged in code \u2013 shorthand grenades of inner tumult and self-loathing. His genius, though, in songs like \"Lithium,\" \"Breed\" and \"Teen Spirit\" was the soft-loud tension he created between verse and chorus, restraint and assault. Cobain was a pop lover at heart \u2013 and a Beatlemaniac: Nevermind producer Butch Vig remembers hearing Cobain play John Lennon's \"Julia\" at sessions. Cobain also fought to maintain his underground honor. Ultimately, it was a losing battle, but it is part of this album's enduring power. Vig recalls when Cobain was forced to overdub the guitar intro to \"Teen Spirit\" because he couldn't nail it live with the band:\u2008\"That pissed him off. He wanted to play [the song] live all the way through.\"","cover":"https:\/\/images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com\/images\/I\/51Y2V2TT2EL._SX258_BO1,204,203,200_.jpg","playlist":"","Collection":"1","\u0424\u043e\u043d\u043e\u0442\u0435\u043a\u0430":"","":"","Vinylbox.ru":"","\u0414\u0438\u0435\u0437":"","Audiomania.ru":""},{"id":"18","artist":"Bruce

on the upbeat. It is very much like the guitar on a James Brown track \u2013 for a drummer, it's great to play with.\" New guitarist Mick Taylor stretched out the Stones' sound in \"Sway,\" \"Can't You Hear Me Knocking\" and \"Moonlight Mile.\" But \"Brown Sugar\" is a classic Stones stomp, and two of the best cuts are country songs: one forlorn (\"Wild Hor\u00adses\") and one funny (\"Dead
